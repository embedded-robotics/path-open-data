{"question_id": 0, "prompt": "How can you best describe the low-power pattern observed in this image of a lymph node?", "text": "The low-power pattern observed in this image of a lymph node is described as a \"starry sky\" appearance. This pattern is characterized by a background of darkly stained lymphocytes, with scattered lighter areas representing macrophages containing apoptotic bodies. The macrophages are often referred to as \"stars\" in this context, giving the image a \"starry sky\" appearance.", "answer_id": "D4mM5ntmipes3SKw9KEq5G", "model_id": "llava-med-v1.5-mistral-7b", "metadata": {}}
{"question_id": 1, "prompt": "What are three main differential diagnostic considerations if this lymph node was sampled from a young teenager with solitary adenopathy?", "text": "The three main differential diagnostic considerations if this lymph node was sampled from a young teenager with solitary adenopathy are:\n\n1. Infectious lymphadenitis: This is the most common cause of lymphadenopathy in children and adolescents. It is usually caused by bacterial or viral infections.\n\n2. Malignant lymphoma: This is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. It can cause lymphadenopathy as a result of the cancer cells infiltrating the lymph nodes.\n\n3. Sarcoidosis: This is a systemic inflammatory disease that can affect various organs, including the lymph nodes. It is characterized by the formation of non-caseating granulomas, which can be seen in the histopathology of the lymph node.\n\nThese three conditions can present with similar clinical features, making it challenging to differentiate between them based solely on the patient's history and symptoms. Further diagnostic tests, such as a biopsy, would be necessary to determine the exact cause of the lymphadenopathy and provide appropriate treatment.", "answer_id": "Pj3q4gVNPuKujwzg5TNcBW", "model_id": "llava-med-v1.5-mistral-7b", "metadata": {}}
