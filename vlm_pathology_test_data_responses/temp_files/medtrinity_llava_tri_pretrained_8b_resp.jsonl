{"question_id": 0, "prompt": "How can you best describe the low-power pattern observed in this image of a lymph node?\n<image>", "text": "The low-power pattern observed in this image of a lymph node can be best described as showing prominent germinal centers with a \"starry sky\" appearance, surrounded by a prominent mantle zone. Additionally, there is a well-developed marginal zone and a prominent stromal component in the background.", "answer_id": "CnDYbLc7mk3huEaLriLwCo", "model_id": "LLaVA-Tri-Pretrained", "metadata": {}}
{"question_id": 1, "prompt": "What are three main differential diagnostic considerations if this lymph node was sampled from a young teenager with solitary adenopathy?\n<image>", "text": "If the lymph node was sampled from a young teenager with solitary adenopathy, three main differential diagnostic considerations would be infectious mononucleosis (caused by the Epstein-Barr virus), lymphoma (cancer of the lymphatic system), and tuberculosis (a bacterial infection). It's important to note that the actual diagnosis would depend on the patient's clinical history, symptoms, and additional diagnostic tests.", "answer_id": "iMuwSHvQJksHzHfESKXZcB", "model_id": "LLaVA-Tri-Pretrained", "metadata": {}}
{"question_id": 2, "prompt": "What is the morphologic alteration being depicted in this enlarged solitary lymph node from a young child?\n<image>", "text": "The morphologic alteration depicted in the enlarged solitary lymph node from a young child is reactive necrotizing lymphadenitis. This condition is characterized by the presence of granuloma formations and foci of necrosis within the lymph node.", "answer_id": "Kfnu2pAszCK4xQZTX6DoCE", "model_id": "LLaVA-Tri-Pretrained", "metadata": {}}
{"question_id": 3, "prompt": "What is the expected immunoarchitecture of the  mantle cells in the alteration being depicted in the image?\n<image>", "text": "The expected immunoarchitecture of the mantle cells in the alteration being depicted in the image is positive for CD20 and negative for CD3. This means that the mantle cells should express the CD20 marker, which is commonly associated with B-cell lymphocytes, while not expressing the CD3 marker, which is typically associated with T-cell lymphocytes.", "answer_id": "LE7aFxrVKesdTR5V9wNSnU", "model_id": "LLaVA-Tri-Pretrained", "metadata": {}}

{"question_id": 5, "prompt": "What is the specific anatomic region shown in the image on the right half of the image?\n<image>", "text": "The right half of the image shows the anatomic region of the ileocecal valve (ICV). The ileocecal valve is the junction between the small intestine (ileum) and the large intestine (cecum).", "answer_id": "cD3UQ2pWgMxfRxeoywKEhk", "model_id": "LLaVA-Tri-Pretrained", "metadata": {}}
{"question_id": 6, "prompt": "If these histologic changes included conspicuous portal plasma cells, what would be the primary consideration for the diagnosis?\n<image>", "text": "If the histologic changes included conspicuous portal plasma cells, the primary consideration for the diagnosis would be chronic rejection.", "answer_id": "SdkZtM2Wt9Enjgi6Uhud2G", "model_id": "LLaVA-Tri-Pretrained", "metadata": {}}
{"question_id": 7, "prompt": "What would the primary histologic feature to suggest a diagnosis of Wilson's disease from the image?\n<image>", "text": "The primary histologic feature to suggest a diagnosis of Wilson's disease in the image would be the presence of copper deposition in the basal ganglia and surrounding perivascular and perineurial areas. This can be observed as dark-brown, fine granules of hemosiderin and fine granules of PAS (diastase-positive) material in the tissue.", "answer_id": "8CqJMA6rFn3uP5t8rb9wyg", "model_id": "LLaVA-Tri-Pretrained", "metadata": {}}
{"question_id": 8, "prompt": "In an overweight adolescent with mildly increased transaminases, what diagnosis do the portal changes here suggest?\n<image>", "text": "The portal changes in the histology image suggest a diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is also known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This condition is characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver and can lead to inflammation and liver damage. It is important to note that a healthcare professional should be consulted for a thorough evaluation and proper diagnosis of the underlying cause of these findings.", "answer_id": "e5roJKWBzL8gXQWXBcDsq3", "model_id": "LLaVA-Tri-Pretrained", "metadata": {}}
